This humble blog is my place to jot down notes with some pressure to maintain
a high level of quality. If you catch a mistake or just want to discuss the
content, please don't hesitate to open an issue or PR on [github](https://github.com/joshklop/joshklop.github.io).
I would love to learn from you.

All opinions are my own (I always wanted to have an About page where I could say
that :)).
